# Shape-The-World-RTBN
Lab solutions for Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World course from Texas University at Austin on edX.org using Tiva C Launchpad.

Only labs 1,2,3 and 5 are solved using off the shelf components like buzzzers, sliders, ..etc. as I did not have access to the MKII boosterpack.
